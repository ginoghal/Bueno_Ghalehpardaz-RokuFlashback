# Bueno_Ghalehpardaz-RokuFlashback


Authors: Gino Ghalehpardaz and Guillerme Bueno

For this project we are creating a roku app that plays Movie trailers, tv show trailers and music.

The content is sorted in 2 distinctive ways. The first by year it was released. The second is that it is currated (based on the content rating) for both children and adults and based on whichever of the account you use you will recieve content that goes with that given age group.
